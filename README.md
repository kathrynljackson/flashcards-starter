# FlashCards Starter Kit
### Mod 2 
## Kathryn Jackson

## Abstract

This project requires writing a program that simulates using flash cards. This program runs in the command line, where the user can see the questions, choose an answer, and see their final score at the end of the round. Test Driven Development is used to drive the implementation of my code.

**The learning goals include:**
* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Setup and Installation

1. In your terminal, [choose the directory](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/command-line-101#:~:text=To%20change%20this%20current%20working,%24%20cd%20..) that you would like to store the game in. 

2. Clone down this repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:kathrynljackson/flashcards-starter.git
```

3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```
npm install
```
4. While the newly installed `flashcards-starter` directory, start the game in your terminal by running:

```
