# FlashCards Starter Kit
### Mod 2 
### Kathryn Jackson
### Extension: [Trello Project Board](https://trello.com/b/cf2Jiow3/flash-cards)

## Abstract

This project requires writing a program that simulates using flash cards. This program runs in the command line, where the user can see the questions, choose an answer, and see their final score at the end of the round. Test Driven Development is used to drive the implementation of my code.

**The learning goals include:**
* Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Installation Instructions

1. In your terminal, [choose the directory](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/appendix/command-line-101#:~:text=To%20change%20this%20current%20working,%24%20cd%20..) that you would like to store the game in. 

2. Clone down this repo.
```
git clone git@github.com:kathrynljackson/flashcards-starter.git
```

3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the newly installed `flashcards-starter` directory and install the library dependencies. Run:
```
npm install
```

4. While in the `flashcards-starter` directory, start the game in your terminal by running:

```
node index.js
```


## Gameplay
You should see something like this in your terminal:

**Flashcards** is a game that tests your knowledge of the concepts covered in Turing FE Module 2. The game is started by running `node index.js`.

1. Use the **up and down arrows on your keyboard** to select the answer to each question.

2. Use the **return key on your keyboard** to choose the correct answer once your choice has been highlighted. 

3. After each answer, you will be notified as to whether or not you chose the correct answer.

4. Use the **return key on your keyboard** to move on to the next question.

5. At the end of the round, you will be shown your overall score.
